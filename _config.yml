  Hi, I'm a full-stack software developer who loves coding. I've been developing software since 2005, and I am experienced mostly in **web development** using <mark>php</mark>, <mark>mysql</mark> and <mark>javascript</mark>. I sometimes code in **c#** and **python** for other stuff, but I find web more exciting and fun. Eating and travelling are also my top skills.
