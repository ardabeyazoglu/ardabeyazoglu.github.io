  Hi, I'm a software engineer in Ljubljana. 
  I started coding in 2003 using no longer available tools, then switched to php-mysql stack and I've been working in web applications since then. Because I worked on medium-to-large client facing projects in a small team, I took care of different roles throughout my career. Mostly working as core developer and team lead, I have experienced a long list of challenges, problems and their solutions, from system design and devops practices, to structuring databases and core backend development. One can use any knowledge at any point in his life, so I keep learning to improve my skills and stay up-to-date.
