    During my study, I learned control theory and its applications in real world problems. I wrote *PLC* programs in *ladder* and procedural languages to control electromechanical systems.
    Although it is not directly connected to my occupation, I've learned theories and practical skills that helped my programming career. I believe that embracing engineering discipline and control theory made my coding skills and algorithms much better.
