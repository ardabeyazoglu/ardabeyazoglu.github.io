    Stepping into the world of coding as a young student
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This was the time I started using my fresh coding skills in real-world scenarios. I did typical freelance projects such as building company websites, ad portals, adding small features or fixing bugs in legacy projects. During this period, I created my first open source project, *-an ajax library for php-* [phplivex](phplivex.sourceforge.net) when concepts like ajax just became popular. I stopped developing it a few years later with the adoption of jquery and similar libraries.
