    I have been responsible for the core development of [KivaCRM](https://www.kivacrm.com) cloud based PaaS/SaaS product, its BI/CRM tools and primary mobile apps as well as leading a team of few people.

    I have been developing the primary web app since the beginning with <mark>extjs</mark> frontend, and <mark>php</mark> backend. I developed various services including **websocket** based real-time notification system, automated workflow system, email/sms marketing services, task/event management, reporting/analytics and so on. I created advanced reports & analytics dashboards from transactional, highly relational datasets in mysql to achieve advanced <mark>BI</mark> experience. I've learned lots of tech stacks during development, some of which are **zend** and **phalcon** php frameworks, **gearman** job queues, **nodejs**, **socket.io**, **firebase**, **sphinxsearch** etc.

    I structured and optimized mysql databases, used <mark>redis</mark> and <mark>memcached</mark> mainly for caching and session management.

    I developed multiple side projects/plugins, such as facebook lead integrations, microsoft office addins and 3rd party integrations. During development I have learned lots of 3rd party APIs such as facebook graph api, ms graph api, ms com library for office addins etc.

    I also developed few hybrid mobile apps written in **extjs/sencha-touch** and **framework7**, built natively with **cordova/phonegap**.

    Stepping into the world of coding as a young student
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    This was the time I started using my fresh coding skills in real-world scenarios. I did some typical freelance projects such as building company websites, adding small features or fixing bugs in legacy projects. During this period, I created my first open source project, *-an ajax library for php-* [PHPLiveX](www.phplivex.com) when concepts like ajax just became popular. I stopped developing it a few years later with the adoption of jquery and similar libraries.
