    I've been coding in php since v4, I started developing websites, ad portals and have been working in saas projects since then. I still like coding in php and I keep refreshing my knowledge by practising new features and patterns.

    I prefer writing object-oriented, readable, maintainable code and avoid reinventing the wheel unless it is really neccesary, so I usually use frameworks in combination with well tested composer libraries to accomplish my tasks. I first started with zend framework and then used phalcon in many areas, but lately I am also interested in laravel and zend-expressive. I am also interested in swoole project that runs php in a similar way to nodejs and golang.

    I have been actively coding in javascript since a very long time ago. I like learning and using newest ecmascript features with babel. 

    I am a fan of reactjs and enthusiastic about using react more and more, as I believe the concepts like state handling, top-down approach, function components, hooks and vast community create great opportunities.

    I have been developing single page apps with extjs and sencha touch(for mobile) for a long time. I created dozens of new components as well as 100s of overrides to implement new features. I know how to structure an extjs app very well and make it performant. I also use extjs in mobile development and universal applications.

    I have been using mysql since 5.1, and now keeping up with 8.0. I have designed and optimized multi-tenant saas databases, from query/index optimizations to kernel tuning and high availibility. I managed 300+ databases per node in a replicated environment with read-write split, which made me experience lots of database issues and os-level problems as well as their solutions. I design my databases with intention to make them scalable and maintainable in the future as well.

    Since I believe that database is the most important part of today's software, I regularly read mysql blogs and updates to stay up-to-date. Mastering an RDBMS requires a lot of experience and deep knowledge, so I would give myself 8 out of 10, to set myself aside from database specialists.
