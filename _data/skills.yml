    I've been coding in php since v4, I started developing websites, ad portals and have been working in saas projects since then. I still like coding in php and I keep refreshing my knowledge by practising new features and patterns.

    I prefer writing object-oriented, readable, maintainable code and avoid reinventing the wheel unless it is really neccesary, so I usually use frameworks in combination with well tested composer libraries to accomplish my tasks. I first started with zend framework and then used phalcon in many areas, but lately I am also interested in laravel and zend-expressive. I am also interested in swoole project that runs php in a similar way to nodejs and golang.

    I have been actively using javascript since I started coding. I keep constantly learning latest ecmascript features, and use them whenever possible.
    Although, I don't prefer spending much time in frontend development, I am carefully following recent improvements in frontend frameworks, such as reactjs, vuejs and svelte lately, which make me enjoy coding frontends.

    I have been developing single page apps with extjs for a long time already. I created dozens of new components as well as hundreds of overrides to implement new features or bug fixes. I have used extjs in both mobile and desktop applications.

    I have been using mysql since 5.1, and now keeping up with 8.0. I have designed and optimized multi-tenant saas databases, from query/index optimizations to kernel tuning and high availibility. I managed 300+ databases per node in a replicated environment with read-write split, which made me experience lots of database issues and os-level problems as well as their solutions. I design databases with intention to make them scalable and maintainable in the future as well. Although I am not a database specialist nor a dba, I am quite interested in database technologies. I believe that a database is the most important part of today's software, so I regularly read mysql blogs and updates to stay up-to-date.
