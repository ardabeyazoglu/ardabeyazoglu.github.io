    My backend experience is mostly based in php, and I am still actively coding in <mark>php7</mark>. I prefer writing object-oriented, readable, and maintainable code. I often avoid reinventing the wheel unless it is really neccesary, so I usually use frameworks in combination with well written composer libraries to accomplish my tasks. I used  <mark>zend framework</mark> and <mark>phalcon</mark> for a long time, and also learning laravel and zend-expressive recently. I am quite interested in async php, and thus <mark>swoole</mark> project which brings coroutine functionality to php.

    I started designing website interfaces a long time ago, using legacy html and javascript, in the <i>bad</i> old days of ie6. I created one of the first old-school php-ajax frameworks called phplivex in 2006, maintained until the trend is obsolete. Then I met evolutionary <mark>extjs</mark> and it became my favourite frontend tool for single-page apps. I've created dozens of new components, web and mobile applications, and I am still a loyal extjs coder. I keep learning latest ecmascript features and cool recent improvements on frontend technologies such as web components. I am also fan of <mark>vuejs</mark> and lately <mark>svelte</mark>.

    I have been using <mark>mysql</mark> since 5.1, and now embracing 8.x. I have designed and optimized multi-tenant saas databases, from query/index optimizations to kernel tuning and high availibility. I managed 300+ databases per node in a replicated environment with read-write split, which made me experience lots of database issues and os-level problems as well as their solutions. Although I am not a database specialist nor a dba, I am quite interested in database technologies. I think a database is the most important part of today's software, and I believe every developer should know how it works and how to use it properly, even if there are other people who deal with it. Baside mysql, I also use nosql databases such as mongodb, redis and firebase. As I am interested, I regularly read database blogs and keep up with new trends.
