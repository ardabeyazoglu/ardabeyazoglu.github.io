      <p>Hi, I’m a full-stack software engineer in Ljubljana. 
I started coding in 2003, using old school visual basic and php4 for web. Since then, I’ve experienced various tech stacks by working in different software, from desktop apps to mostly web apps and taking care of different roles. My favourite stack includes <mark>php</mark>, <mark>mysql</mark> <mark>javascript</mark> on <mark>ubuntu</mark>; however, I also like coding in different languages, and learning recent stacks to stay up-to-date.
<br /><br />
I always try to do my work with engineering principles, plan in advance, split into parts, prioritize, decouple and test. Although there is no limit of learning and the entire stack nowadays is too deep and wide for a single person, I would like to know as many things as possible, and enjoy learning. This is why I read a lot about recent trends and techs, such as devops, containers, serverless, machine learning. One can use any knowledge at any point in his life.</p>

        <p>My backend experience is mostly based in php, and I am still actively coding in <mark>php7</mark>. I prefer writing object-oriented, readable, and maintainable code. I often avoid reinventing the wheel unless it is really neccesary, so I usually use frameworks in combination with well written composer libraries to accomplish my tasks. I used  <mark>zend framework</mark> and <mark>phalcon</mark> for a long time, and also learning laravel and zend-expressive recently. I am quite interested in async php, and thus <mark>swoole</mark> project which brings coroutine functionality to php.</p>

        <p>I started designing website interfaces a long time ago, using legacy html and javascript, in the <i>bad</i> old days of ie6. I created one of the first old-school php-ajax frameworks called phplivex in 2006, maintained until the trend is obsolete. Then I met evolutionary <mark>extjs</mark> and it became my favourite frontend tool for single-page apps. I’ve created dozens of new components, web and mobile applications, and I am still a loyal extjs coder. I keep learning latest ecmascript features and cool recent improvements on frontend technologies such as web components. I am also fan of <mark>vuejs</mark> and lately <mark>svelte</mark>.</p>

        <p>I have been using <mark>mysql</mark> since 5.1, and now embracing 8.x. I have designed and optimized multi-tenant saas databases, from query/index optimizations to kernel tuning and high availibility. I managed 300+ databases per node in a replicated environment with read-write split, which made me experience lots of database issues and os-level problems as well as their solutions. Although I am not a database specialist nor a dba, I am quite interested in database technologies. I think a database is the most important part of today’s software, and I believe every developer should know how it works and how to use it properly, even if there are other people who deal with it. Baside mysql, I also use nosql databases such as mongodb, redis and firebase. As I am interested, I regularly read database blogs and keep up with new trends.</p>
