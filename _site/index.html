<p>I have been developing the primary web app since the beginning with <mark>extjs</mark> frontend, and <mark>php</mark> backend. I developed various services including <strong>websocket</strong> based real-time notification system, automated workflow system, email/sms marketing services, task/event management, reporting/analytics and so on. I created advanced reports &amp; analytics dashboards from transactional, highly relational datasets in mysql to achieve advanced <mark>BI</mark> experience. I’ve learned lots of tech stacks during development, some of which are <strong>zend</strong> and <strong>phalcon</strong> php frameworks, <strong>gearman</strong> job queues, <strong>nodejs</strong>, <strong>socket.io</strong>, <strong>firebase</strong>, <strong>sphinxsearch</strong> etc.</p>

<p>I structured and optimized mysql databases, used <mark>redis</mark> and <mark>memcached</mark> mainly for caching and session management.</p>

<p>I developed multiple side projects/plugins, such as facebook lead integrations, microsoft office addins and 3rd party integrations. During development I have learned lots of 3rd party APIs such as facebook graph api, ms graph api, ms com library for office addins etc.</p>

<p>I also developed few hybrid mobile apps written in <strong>extjs/sencha-touch</strong> and <strong>framework7</strong>, built natively with <strong>cordova/phonegap</strong>.</p>

Although it is not directly connected to my occupation, I’ve learned theories and practical skills that helped my programming career. I believe that embracing engineering discipline and control theory made my coding skills and algorithms much better.</p>

        <p>I’ve been coding in php since v4, I started developing websites, ad portals and have been working in saas projects since then. I still like coding in php and I keep refreshing my knowledge by practising new features and patterns.</p>

<p>I prefer writing object-oriented, readable, maintainable code and avoid reinventing the wheel unless it is really neccesary, so I usually use frameworks in combination with well tested composer libraries to accomplish my tasks. I first started with zend framework and then used phalcon in many areas, but lately I am also interested in laravel and zend-expressive. I am also interested in <strong>swoole</strong> extension that runs php in a similar way to nodejs or golang, and I believe event-based php might be the future of the language and possibly web.</p>

        <p>I write mostly client-side javascript; however, I like using nodejs as well. I always prefer to code using latest ecmascript features and use babel to transpile them. I am also interested in typescript lately.</p>

<p>I am a fan of client side frameworks and tools like reactjs and webpack. I am enthusiastic about using react more and more, as I believe the concepts like state handling, top-down approach, function components, hooks and easy integration with other libs are great improvements over the web.</p>

<p>I use nodejs for some microservices and small components, such as messaging services, real time notifications, although I never code entire stack in nodejs.</p>

        <p>I have been developing single page apps with extjs and sencha touch(for mobile) for a long time. I created dozens of new components as well as 100s of overrides to implement new features. I know how to structure an extjs app very well and use it performant. Although it might be too expensive for small projects, I think it is still the best UI framework for large scale products or enterprise applications.</p>

<p>I also use extjs in mobile development and universal applications. I’ve developed few mobile apps using sencha touch with a large codebase. Nowadays, I would prefer using extjs6 modern toolkit for both mobile and desktop applications.</p>

        <p>I have been using mysql since 5.1, and now keeping up with 8.0. I didn’t choose it for a specific reason at the beginning; however, I did the right choice. Today, it is the most commonly used rdbms, it is open source and actively developed by professionals, or extended by others like Percona and Mariadb. I like its simpler learning curve and the opportunity to find almost anything on the web you would search for.</p>

<p>I have designed and optimized multi-tenant saas databases, from query/index optimizations to kernel tuning and high availibility. I managed 300+ databases per node in a replicated environment with read-write split, which made me experience lots of database issues and os-level problems as well as their solutions. I design my databases with intention to make them scalable and maintainable in the future as well.</p>

<p>Since I believe that database is the most important part of today’s software, I regularly read mysql blogs and updates to stay up-to-date. Mastering an RDBMS requires a lot of experience and deep knowledge, so I would give myself 8 out of 10, to set myself aside from database specialists.</p>
