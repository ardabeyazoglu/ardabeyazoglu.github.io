      <p>Hi, I’m a full-stack software developer who loves coding. I’ve been developing software since 2005, and I am experienced mostly in <strong>web development</strong> using <mark>php</mark>, <mark>mysql</mark> and <mark>javascript</mark>. I sometimes code in <strong>c#</strong> and <strong>python</strong> for different stuff, but I enjoy web development more in general. Other than those, eating and travelling are also my top skills.</p>

</p><p>I am responsible for the core development of <a href="https://www.kivacrm.com">KivaCRM</a> cloud based PaaS/SaaS product, its BI/CRM tools and primary mobile apps as well as leading a team of few people.</p>

<p>I have been developing the primary web app since the beginning with <mark>extjs</mark> frontend, and <mark>php</mark> backend. I developed various services including <strong>websocket</strong> based real-time notification system, automated workflow system, email/sms marketing services, reporting/analytics for BI and so on. I used <strong>php</strong> and <mark>mysql</mark> to improve <mark>BI</mark> experience by creating complex but presentable reports and analytics of transactional, highly relational database. I’ve experienced lots of tech stacks during development, some of which are <strong>zend</strong> and <strong>phalcon</strong> php frameworks, <strong>gearman</strong> job queues, <strong>nodejs</strong>, <strong>socket.io</strong>, <strong>firebase</strong>, <strong>sphinxsearch</strong> for fulltext search as well as <strong>sql</strong>.</p>

<p>I structured and constantly optimized mysql databases as the single source of truth for the applications. I experienced <mark>redis</mark> and <mark>memcached</mark> as well, using them especially for caching and session storage.</p>

<p>I developed multiple side projects/plugins, such as facebook lead integrations, microsoft office addins and 3rd party integrations. During development I have learned lots of 3rd party APIs such as facebook graph api, ms graph api, ms com library for office addins etc.</p>

<p>I also developed few hybrid mobile apps written in <strong>extjs/sencha-touch</strong> and built natively with <strong>cordova/phonegap</strong>.</p>

</p><p>This was the time I started using my fresh coding skills in real-world scenarios. I did some typical freelance projects such as building company websites, adding small features or fixing bugs in legacy projects. During this period, I created my first open source project, <em>-an ajax library for php-</em> <a href="www.phplivex.com">PHPLiveX</a> when concepts like ajax just became popular. I stopped developing it a few years later with the adoption of jquery and similar libraries.</p>

Although it is not directly connected to my occupation, I’ve learned theories and practical skills that helped my programming career. I believe that embracing engineering discipline and control theory made my coding skills and algorithms much better.</p>
